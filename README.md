AirBnB Clone project:This project contains cloned AirBnB full stack Web application with only the back end part and simulating front end in command interpeter.

Command Interpeter: Helps to simulate the front end part of the web application and it can be run using terminal in either interactive or none interactive ways. To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution of the file console.py at the command line.
eg.

$ echo "help" | ./console.py

Alternatively, to use the AirBnB console in interactive mode, run the file console.py by itself:
eg.
$ ./console.py
